# maker-portfolio
Hi there!

Because I am unable to make the whole Boris AI Denoiser repository public, I have taken only the most relevent notebooks, which include all of the code I referenced in the video, and placed them here to supplement my maker portfolio. `dataset.ipynb` contains the Python code to create a training dataset from a directory of source videos. `denoise.ipynb` contains code to load data, define the denoising model, train the model, make predictions with Python, and convert the PyTorch model to Core ML format.

Enjoy!
