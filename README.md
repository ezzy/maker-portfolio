Hi there!
This repository contains the most relevent code from the boris-fx/ai repo that holds all the code for the Boris AI Denoiser, including all the code referenced in the video. `dataset.ipynb` contains the Python code to create a training dataset from a directory of source videos. `denoise.ipynb` contains code to load data, define the denoising model, train the model, make predictions with python, and convert the PyTorch model to CoreML format.
Enjoy!
